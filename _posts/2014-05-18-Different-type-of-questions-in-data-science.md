These are the different classifications of questions a Data Scientist can ask :

1. **Exploratory**

2. **Descriptive**

3. **Inferential**

4. **Predictive**

5. **Causal**
Causal question are usually asked to find out what happens to one variable when you change another.

- Implementation usually requires randomized studies
- There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies
- Causal models are said to be the “gold standard” for data analysis
- Type of data set applied to: Randomized Trial Data Set – data from a randomized study

Causal analysis aims to explain the causal relations between variables. If you want to indicate explicit causality, your study must include an experiment. You compare the control and treatment groups, for example, with variance analysis.  i

You may also use regression analysis, which measures causality in a weaker way. Regression analysis enables you to explore the influence of several variables on a single variable at the same time. Regression analysis may also focus on exploring the intensity of the influence of a single variable.

6. **Mechanistic**
