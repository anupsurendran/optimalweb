Here is another example of using D3 to generate stats driven visualization. 
I wanted to read the data from Google spreadsheets but then the lazy me thought that it will be easier just to add the traffic ratio attribute within the “us-state-centroids.json” file.
Here is how it looks now :



The large circles indicates large commutes.
As you see most of the data is not even complete and since this just a work in progress, I wil make another revision to it hopefully shortly.
The full html file to the U.S visualization can be found here.
