<h2 id='types'>Types</h2>

<p><strong>SQL</strong> : One type (SQL database) with minor variations</p>

<p><strong>NOSQL</strong> : Many different types including key-value stores, document databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases  </p>

<h2 id='schemas'>Schemas</h2>

<p><strong>SQL</strong>: Structure and data types are fixed in advance. To store information about a new data item, the entire database must be altered, during which time the database must be taken offline.</p>

<p><strong>NOSQL</strong>: Typically dynamic. Records can add new information on the fly, and unlike SQL table rows, dissimilar data can be stored together as necessary. For some databases (e.g., wide-column stores), it is somewhat more challenging to add new fields dynamically.</p>
