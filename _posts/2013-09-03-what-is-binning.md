Binning is a way to group a number of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of “bins”. For example, if you have data about a group of people, you might want to arrange their ages into a smaller number of age intervals. 
In the example below, we have data about temperature in a region ordered based on the date of the month. It is hard to visualize what the range of temperature was for that region was.

Binning helps in visualizing these values. The first step is to find the occurences of the temperature. The table below shows occurences of a temperature range.
