<p>Binning is a way to group a number of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of “bins”. For example, if you have data about a group of people, you might want to arrange their ages into a smaller number of age intervals.  In the example below, we have data about temperature in a region ordered based on the date of the month. It is hard to visualize what the range of temperature was for that region was.</p>

<p> Binning helps in visualizing these values. The first step is to find the occurences of the temperature. The table below shows occurences of a temperature range.</p>
